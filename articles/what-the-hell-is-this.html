></title-image>

<p>Back in the late â€™90s, when the internet was still in its dial-up awkward phase, I was hooked. The vastness of information was thrilling. But there was a problem. I found it overwhelming, chaotic, noisy, and hard to follow. I loved it, but I struggled to stay with it.</p>

<p>When text-to-speech tools emerged, I found some relief. But for most people, there was no problem to solve so nothing changed. That tension between effort and accessibility has stuck with me ever since.</p>

<p>Fast-forward to today, and Iâ€™ve built something I wish existed back then: a simple tool to make websites easier to use for people who think a little differently.</p>

<h3>Introducing CogJS</h3>

<p><strong>CogJS</strong> is a small, free tool for making websites easier to use for people with ADHD, autism, dyslexia, sensory sensitivity, anxiety, or just a different way of processing the world.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s not flashy. Itâ€™s not technical magic. But it <strong>is</strong> useful. It quietly adds helpful features to websites, like:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Letting users switch to calmer colors that reduce visual strain</li>
    <li>Turning off flashy animations that cause sensory overload</li>
    <li>Breaking long pages into small steps that are easier to process</li>
    <li>Letting users choose between simplified or detailed content</li>
    <li>Reading text aloud at the click of a button</li>
    <li>Showing little reminders or helpful nudges when it matters</li>
</ul>

<p>Most people wonâ€™t even notice it. But for those who need it, it can be the difference between staying engaged and giving up.</p>

<h3>Why It Matters</h3>

<p>We often design websites with one type of user in mind: someone who reads quickly, focuses easily, navigates confidently, and never misses a step. But thatâ€™s not all of us.</p>

<p>Consider this:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>1 in 7 people</strong> is neurodivergent, according to the UK government.</li>
    <li><strong>10% of people</strong> have dyslexia, which can make reading and comprehension difficult.</li>
    <li><strong>Up to 20%</strong> live with sensory differences, where clutter, noise, and motion can become overwhelming.</li>
    <li><strong>96.3% of websites</strong> fail basic accessibility checks. Cognitive accessibility is rarely considered at all.</li>
</ul>

<p>That means millions of users are left out but not by intention, by default.</p>

<h3>Built for the Real Web</h3>

<p>CogJS was built to be as easy to adopt as possible. Not everyone runs a tech company with a dedicated accessibility team. Many sites are run by individuals, small teams, charities, or people doing their best with limited time and tools.</p>

<p>So CogJS works with any website, no frameworks, no rebuilds, no steep learning curve. Whether itâ€™s a local blog, a university portal, or a complex application, CogJS is flexible enough to slot in and make a difference.</p>

<h3>And This Is Just the Start</h3>

<p>CogJS already supports a wide range of features and more are on the way. Features that help users manage memory load, reduce distractions, and navigate more intuitively are all in development. The goal is to keep building, not just features, but a movement.</p>

<h3>Why I Made It</h3>

<p>This tool is deeply personal. Iâ€™ve navigated my life and career with ADHD and dyslexia. I know what itâ€™s like to feel left behind by systems that werenâ€™t made with you in mind. Thatâ€™s why I built CogJS. To offer something better. Something kinder.</p>

<h3>Want to Try It?</h3>

<p>If you build websites or manage digital content, take a look. Even one small change could help someone stay focused, find their place, or feel seen.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s build a web that works for more people. Not just most people.</p>
