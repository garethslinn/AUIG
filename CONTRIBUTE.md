### **🌟 Join Me in Building Accessible User Interfaces! 🌟**

Hello, I’m **Gareth Slinn**, and I’m passionate about transforming digital interfaces to make them accessible for individuals with diverse abilities, including those with neurological, cognitive, and psychological challenges. I’ve developed the **Accessible User Interface Guidelines (AUIG)**—a draft framework to help design, develop, and test inclusive user interfaces. **I need your help to bring this vision to life!**

### **🔍 What Is the AUIG Project?**

The **Accessible User Interface Guidelines (AUIG)** is a comprehensive set of guidelines that simplify the implementation of **accessible, inclusive user interfaces**. Based on W3C standards and expanded to include considerations like neurodiversity, AUIG provides practical guidance for creating equitable digital experiences.
