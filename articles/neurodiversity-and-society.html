<p>
    Neurodiversity isnâ€™t always seen as a disability, nor do we wear a label announcing it. For many of us, including those with ADHD, the term <em>disabled</em> doesnâ€™t feel like it fits. But that doesnâ€™t mean our experiences arenâ€™t valid. The real issue isnâ€™t our brains, itâ€™s the rigid way society defines disability.
</p>
<p>
    Disability is often framed in a way that only accounts for whatâ€™s visible or fits neatly into a checklist. But what about the challenges that arenâ€™t immediately obvious? ADHD isnâ€™t just about being forgetful or distracted. Itâ€™s about navigating a world designed for a completely different cognitive style, where something as simple as filling out long forms, sorting through overwhelming amounts of information, or structuring a daily routine can become exhausting.
</p>
<p>
    Beyond the practical struggles, thereâ€™s also the weight of past experiences. Many of us go undiagnosed for years, often hearing that weâ€™re lazy, careless, or not living up to expectations. These messages donâ€™t just disappear with a diagnosis, they shape how we see ourselves, fueling anxiety, frustration, and even shame. The mental toll of being misunderstood isnâ€™t something you can measure with a checklist, but itâ€™s no less real than any other barrier.
</p>
<p>
    Rather than focusing on whether ADHD and similar conditions "qualify" as disabilities, the conversation needs to shift. Labels donâ€™t define experience, and lived reality isnâ€™t something that can be neatly categorised. People shouldnâ€™t have to prove theyâ€™re struggling just to be taken seriously. Instead of gatekeeping who gets support and understanding, we should be asking how to make the world more navigable for <em>everyone.</em>
</p>
<p>
    Itâ€™s not about seeking special treatment, itâ€™s about recognising that inclusion means more than just accommodating the most obvious needs. It means rethinking outdated ideas, challenging assumptions, and making space for perspectives that donâ€™t always fit the mold. Because real accessibility isnâ€™t just about what you can see, itâ€™s about what you choose to understand.
