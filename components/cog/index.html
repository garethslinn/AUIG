<h1>Accessible User Interface Guidelines</h1>

<h2>CogJS â€“ Cognitive-Oriented Web Accessibility Toolkit</h2>

<h3>Introducing CogJS</h3>

<p>
    <strong>CogJS</strong> is a lightweight, production-ready JavaScript library designed to improve web accessibility for neurodivergent and cognitively diverse users. It enables developers to enhance user experience using simple, declarative HTML attributes-no frameworks, build tools, or heavy dependencies required.
</p>

<p>
    Unlike traditional accessibility tools that primarily focus on screen readers or motor impairments, CogJS addresses the needs of users with ADHD, autism spectrum conditions, dyslexia, cognitive fatigue, and sensory sensitivities.
</p>

<p>
    With CogJS, you can reduce cognitive load, increase clarity, and offer more user control-right from your markup.
</p>

    The full source code and documentation are available on <a href="https://github.com/garethslinn/cog" aria-description="(Opens in a new tab)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>.
