<p>
    If you’ve ever found yourself obsessing after a neutral message, an unanswered email, or a vague 
    facial expression then welcome to the club. It’s that sinking feeling that you’ve said too much,
    come on too strong, or ruined something without knowing why. It can feel overwhelmingly painful, 
    triggering feelings of dread, deep concern, and even shame.
</p>

<p>
    That experience is often labelled <strong>Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria</strong> (RSD). For people
    with ADHD, it can feel like being emotionally crushed by something as simple as silence. It’s intense. And relentless.
</p>

<p>
    But here’s a theory I’ve been working on: What if RSD isn’t just about emotional hypersensitivity? What if it’s
    a by-product of one of our greatest strengths  <strong>hyperfocus</strong>  being turned against us?
</p>

<h3>ADHD, Hyperfocus, and the Need for Resolve</h3>

<p>
    Hyperfocus is one of those weird ADHD traits that’s both a blessing and a curse. When we care about
    something, we can zero in with laser intensity. We lose track of time, space  everything. We love it
    when it’s directed at a creative project or a problem we can actually solve.
</p>

<p>
    When that focus is locked onto something rewarding, our brains are flooded with <strong>dopamine</strong>
    the neurotransmitter that drives motivation and pleasure. It’s what gives us that addictive,
    immersive quality when we’re building, designing, coding, researching, or even just hyperfixating on a topic we love.
</p>

<p>
    But when that same intensity turns inward toward a <em>perceived social threat</em>  like a confusing
    silence or ambiguous facial expression where there’s no dopamine. Instead, our brain releases <strong>cortisol</strong>
    (the stress hormone) and sometimes <strong>adrenaline</strong>. These chemicals prep us for danger, not productivity.
</p>

<p>
    So what starts as a desire to resolve uncertainty becomes a stress-fueled loop with no real exit. We're no
    longer solving a problem  we're simulating scenarios that can't be answered with the information we have.
</p>

<p>
    This isn’t just overthinking. It’s our problem-solving engine locking onto a threat it can’t see clearly
    and running simulations non-stop.
</p>

<h3>RSD as Inward-Facing Hyperfocus</h3>

<p>
    My theory is simple: RSD might not be a flaw in our emotional system. It could be <strong>cognitive hyperfocus with
    no external anchor</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    When we don’t get clarity or feedback, our brains treat that as unfinished business. We turn inward,
    running loops: “Did I say something wrong?” “Did I ruin it?” “Should I follow up? Or just disappear forever?”
</p>

<p>
    It’s not that we’ve been rejected  it’s that we’re caught in a loop without closure. The emotional
    pain is real, but it might be caused by our strongest trait, the ability to focus deeply turning
    in the wrong direction.
</p>

<h3>How This Reframe Can Help</h3>

<p>
    Understanding RSD this way opens up new strategies for managing it. Here are a few I’ve found helpful:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Interrupt the loop</strong>  Use movement, music, a cold drink  anything sensory that snaps you out of your head.</li>
    <li><strong>Label it</strong>  “This isn’t rejection. This is me trying to solve an invisible problem.”</li>
    <li><strong>Delay the verdict</strong> If you’re unsure what someone meant, park it. You can
        revisit it when your brain’s not spinning.</li>
    <li><strong>Ground yourself in evidence</strong>  Ask: “Do I <em>know</em> they’re upset, or am I guessing?”</li>
</ul>

<p>
    We can’t stop our brains from needing closure but we can learn when to hit pause and let the loop die a natural death.
</p>

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>
    Maybe RSD isn’t about weakness. Maybe it’s about <strong>how deeply we care</strong>  and how hard our minds
    try to make sense of silence.
</p>

<p>
    For people with ADHD, it’s not that we feel <em>too much</em>. It’s that our thoughts go places others never
    even notice. We’re not broken. We just need different tools  and a bit more self-compassion  to steer the
    engine in the right direction.
