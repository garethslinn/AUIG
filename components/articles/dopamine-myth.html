<p>
    The idea that ADHD is just a “dopamine problem” is lazy science and it’s hurting people. It’s the kind of half-truth that spreads because it’s convenient, not because it’s correct. Yes, dopamine is involved. But boiling a deeply complex neurological condition down to a single brain chemical is worse than unhelpful, it’s dangerous.
</p>

<p>
    Stimulants like Ritalin and Adderall <em>do</em> work for some people. They increase dopamine and norepinephrine, and that can improve attention. But acting like that’s the magic fix is like saying you fixed a broken computer by turning up the brightness. Sure, something changed but the system’s still full of deeper issues no one’s talking about.
</p>

<p>
    ADHD isn’t just about dopamine. It’s about how our brains are wired to move, feel, focus, and react in a world that expects robotic uniformity. We’re talking about the <strong>prefrontal cortex</strong>, the <strong>default mode network</strong>, <strong>executive function</strong>, emotional regulation, memory, sleep, the whole damn operating system.
</p>

<p>
    The DMN, the part of the brain responsible for internal thought doesn’t shut off the same way for us. That’s not “a dopamine thing.” That’s our brains refusing to run on the same rails everyone else thinks are normal. And instead of designing systems to meet us halfway, the world shoves pills into our mouths and tells us to keep up.
</p>

<p>
    This obsession with dopamine leads to shallow assumptions and missed diagnoses. It ignores women and girls who mask. It overlooks the adults whose lives quietly unravel under the weight of invisible struggle. It enables gatekeeping by professionals who don’t see the full picture, and worse, don’t care to.
</p>

<p>
    ADHD deserves better than this narrative. We are not broken dopaminergic machines. We are people navigating a hostile, inflexible world, one that would rather sedate us than change itself. If you want to help, stop parroting half-baked myths and start listening. Real support starts with understanding, not compliance.
