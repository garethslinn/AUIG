    <span slot="title">1.1.1 Customised themes</span>
    <span slot="description">
        Consider the possibility that light and dark modes might not address every
        edge case, leaving some users still struggling with the theme. It may be
        impractical to account for all potential challenges. To mitigate this,
        consider adding a settings feature that allows users to customise and
        save their own theme preferences locally in their browser. Including a
        reset option for reverting to the default theme would also be beneficial.

<h4 id="1.1.2">1.1.2 Contrast</h4>
<p>Ensure sufficient contrast between text and background colors to aid users with low vision or
    color-blindness.</p>
<h5>Automatic Calculation:</h5>
<p>The <a href="https://www.checkmeister.com/tools/contrast-tool">Checkmeister Contrast Checking Tool</a>
    is an essential utility for ensuring that your website meets the required accessibility standards.
    Proper contrast between text and background colors is vital for readability, especially for users
    with visual impairments. This tool helps you evaluate and adjust color combinations to achieve the
    best possible contrast ratios.</p>

<h5>Manual Calculation:</h5>
<p>While using online tools is recommended for accuracy, understanding the manual calculation can be
    beneficial.</p>
<p><strong>Formula:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-html">Contrast Ratio = (L1 + 0.05) / (L2 + 0.05)</code></pre>
<ul>
    <li><strong>L1:</strong> Relative luminance of the lighter color.</li>
    <li><strong>L2:</strong> Relative luminance of the darker color.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Relative Luminance Calculation:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Convert RGB values to linear RGB.</li>
    <li>Apply the relative luminance formula provided by WCAG.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Manual calculations are complex and prone to errors. It's advisable to use
    online tools for precise measurements.</p>

    <span slot="description">
        Flashing images can trigger seizures and cause significant discomfort for individuals with
        photosensitive epilepsy, posing serious health risks. To ensure an inclusive and safe
        environment, avoid using flashing or strobe visuals. If their use is unavoidable, provide
        advance warnings to users.

<h3 id="1.2">1.2 General Settings</h3>

<h4 id="1.2.1">1.2.1 Keyboard Access</h4>
<p>Implement keyboard-navigable web interfaces to support users who cannot use a mouse.</p>

<h4 id="1.2.2">1.2.2 Skip Links</h4>
<p>The user should be able to jump ahead of specific elements such
    as the navigation and go directly to the main content.  This is particularly important for assistive
    technologies such as screen readers.</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-html">
&lt;!-- Skip link to the main content --&gt;
&lt;a href="#main-content" class="skip-link"&gt;Go to main content&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;main id="main-content"&gt;
    &lt;!-- Main content goes here --&gt;
&lt;/main&gt;
</code>
</pre>

<h4 id="1.2.3">1.2.3 Responsive Design</h4>
<p>Responsive design ensures that digital content is accessible and legible across all devices,
    from desktops to smartphones. By adapting to various screen sizes and orientations, responsive design
    enhances accessibility for users with mobility limitations who rely on different devices, and
    improves usability for all users by providing a consistent experience regardless of the device used.</p>


<h3 id="1.3">1.3 Localisation</h3>
<p>Use the correct language for the document using the <strong>lang</strong> attribute.  If the language changes
    in any part of the document then state the corresponding language</p>
<pre>
<code class="language-html">
&lt;!-- Example of setting the document language --&gt;
&lt;html lang="en"&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is a paragraph in English.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code>
</pre>

<pre>
<code class="language-html">
&lt;!-- Example of changing language within a document --&gt;
&lt;p lang="en"&gt;This is an English text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p lang="fr"&gt;Ceci est un texte en fran√ßais.&lt;/p&gt;
</code>
</pre>

<h3 id="1.4">1.4 Meta Data:</h3>
<h4 id="1.4.1">1.4.1 Meta</h4>
<p>Use meta tags to provide essential information about the page to search engines and assistive
    technologies.</p>

<h4 id="1.4.2">1.4.2 Title</h4>
<p>Ensure each page has a meaningful title that clearly describes its content for better
    navigation and orientation.</p>

    <span slot="title">1.5 Consistent Layout</span>
    <span slot="description">
        Consistency in UI layout is essential for creating a seamless, intuitive user experience.
        When elements like navigation menus, buttons, and interactive components are consistently
        placed in predictable locations, users can interact with your interface more efficiently,
        without the mental friction of having to search for familiar features. A sudden shift in
        where a key element is located or an unexpected layout change can disrupt the user's
        flow and cause confusion and anxiety. By adhering to consistent placement rules, such
        as always positioning close buttons in the top right or using uniform modal components, designers
        should ensure that users feel confident navigating the interface, <strong>reducing cognitive load</strong> and
        enhancing overall usability. Predictability is key to building trust and ensuring that users
        can focus on tasks rather than figuring out how to use the interface.
