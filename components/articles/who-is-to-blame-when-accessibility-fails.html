<p>Accessibility isn’t one person’s responsibility, it’s a team commitment! When relegated to the end of a project as a "nice-to-have", it leads to costly rework and missed opportunities. Every role plays a part in ensuring inclusivity from the start.</p>

<p>Designers ensure color contrast, scalable typography, and layouts work for everyone.</p>

<p>UX Professionals advocate for accessibility in workflows, personas, and testing.</p>

<p>Project Managers prioritise accessibility as non-negotiable, embedding it into timelines and deliverables.</p>

<p>Clients must see accessibility as a moral and business imperative, not an extra cost.</p>

<p>Business Analysts define accessibility requirements in user stories and acceptance criteria.</p>

<p>Developers write clean, semantic code and ensure assistive tech compatibility.</p>

<p>Testers validate usability and catch gaps with assistive tools.</p>

<p>Accessibility is a shared responsibility and a professional standard. The real question isn’t "Who is responsible?" but "How can we ensure no one is excluded?"</p>
