<p>
    Automated accessibility tools are a vital part of the modern web development workflow. They can quickly scan for common
    issues like missing alt attributes or poor color contrast, giving teams a valuable starting point. However, relying
    solely on automation creates a false sense of compliance and ignores the nuances of real-world user experiences.
</p>
<p>
    Manual testing, on the other hand, brings human insight into the equation. Interacting with websites through assistive
    technologies like screen readers, switch devices, or voice recognition tools reveals usability barriers that no automated
    script can detect. These tools cannot simulate the cognitive load of a user with ADHD or understand how a person with
    anxiety might struggle with poorly structured navigation.
</p>
<p>
    Neurological and psychological accessibility testing is another critical area where automation falls short. Every
    individual processes information differently. A one-size-fits-all approach to accessibility not only overlooks these
    differences but can actively harm user experiences. For example, a design optimised for visual accessibility might
    inadvertently create distractions for users with neurological conditions.
</p>
<p>
    The myth of "universal accessibility" often drives teams to implement generic fixes, thinking they’ve covered every
    user’s needs. This mindset can backfire, alienating users who fall outside the assumed norm. Real inclusivity requires
    a layered, adaptable approach that incorporates diverse perspectives and needs.
</p>
<p>
    Automation is a powerful ally, but it cannot replace the empathy and adaptability of human testing. To build truly
    accessible digital experiences, we must go beyond the checklist mentality. Investing in manual testing, involving
    users with disabilities, and understanding the complexities of human interaction with technology ensures that
    accessibility efforts genuinely benefit everyone.
</p>
<p>
    Don’t make the mistake of thinking accessibility begins and ends with automated tools. By combining automation
    with thoughtful, human-centered design and testing, we can create a web that’s not only compliant but genuinely
    inclusive.
