    <!-- Section: Global Settings -->
    <section itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork">
        <h3 itemprop="headline">Global Settings</h3>
        <p itemprop="description">
            The Global Settings section outlines foundational elements that apply universally across the entire web platform. It emphasizes the importance of core issues that apply to the main layout and across the application/site. Such issues include Colour, Contrast, Language, Keyboard Access, Meta Data, Skip Links, Responsive Design, Flashing Images.
            From a planning perspective, global settings should be prioritised when developing a new application or website, or when upgrading an existing legacy system.

    <!-- Section: Elements -->
    <section itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork">
        <h3 itemprop="headline">Elements</h3>
        <p itemprop="description">
            The Elements section examines specific user interface (UI) components, providing comprehensive best practices to ensure each element is fully accessible. Accessibility should be seamlessly integrated into every phase of the project lifecycle, including design, user experience (UX), development, and quality assurance (QA).
            This includes but not exclusively elements such as Multimedia (images, audio, video etc), Forms, Tables, Headings etc.

        <h3 itemprop="headline">Components</h3>
        <p itemprop="description">
            The Components section concentrates on the accessibility considerations of complex user interface (UI) elements. It covers components such as modals, tooltips, tabs, and accordions. This section provides essential guidelines and illustrative examples to assist in implementing accessible components effectively. Users are encouraged to develop their own methods for achieving accessibility rather than strictly adhering to the provided examples. The primary focus is to ensure that each component is accessible and meets all relevant accessibility requirements.
