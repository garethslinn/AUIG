<!-- Section: Accessibility Journey -->
<section id="accessibility-journey">
  <h3>Accessibility Since 2002</h3>
  <p>
    My journey into accessibility began in 2002 with the creation of my first tool, <strong>Hermish</strong>. Although obsolete today, Hermish marked the start of my dedication to improving web accessibility.
    Back then, accessibility achievements were often rewarded with badges, but the field has evolved significantly since those early days.
  </p>
  <p>
    My passion for accessibility was sparked by my personal experience with text-to-speech tools in the early 2000s. I realised that as the web expanded, so too would the audience  and the need for accessible
    technologies. This understanding has driven my work for over two decades.

  <!-- Accessibility by Example -->
  <article>
    <h4>Accessibility by Example (2007)</h4>
    <p>
      In 2007, I wrote <em>Accessibility by Example</em>, a pocket guide aimed at helping developers navigate the complexities of web accessibility. The book provided practical, actionable insights
      during a time when W3C standards were difficult to fully grasp. Although out of print, its impact remains significant.

  <!-- Accessibility: Don't Panic -->
  <article>
    <h4>Accessibility: Don't Panic (2022)</h4>
    <p>
      <em>Accessibility: Donâ€™t Panic</em> is a step-by-step guide to meeting EAA and WCAG guidelines. With a calm and practical approach, this book equips developers, designers, and business owners with
      the tools to create inclusive and compliant websites. In a world where 20% of web traffic comes from individuals with disabilities, this book is your roadmap to getting accessibility right the first time.

<!-- Section: Neurological UX -->
<section id="neurological-ux">
  <h3>NeurologicalUX: Leading Accessibility in Design</h3>
  <p>
    Accessibility isnâ€™t just about code itâ€™s about design. My work in NeurologicalUX focuses on the unique needs of individuals with neurological differences, such as autism, ADHD, and dyslexia.
    These differences shape how users perceive and interact with digital content, yet theyâ€™re often overlooked in design practices.
  </p>
  <p>
    With the anticipated release of <strong>WCAG 3.0</strong>, accessibility guidelines are poised to evolve, incorporating a deeper understanding of user needs. My upcoming book for designers explores these
    changes and provides actionable insights for creating truly inclusive digital experiences.
  </p>
  <p>
    Designers are not just creators of aesthetic interfaces; they are architects of experiences that can empower or exclude. This book is dedicated to those ready to lead the charge in making digital
    experiences accessible for everyone.
