   ```

---

## Usage

### View the Guidelines Locally

1. **Start the Development Server**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Access the Local Site**

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to explore the guidelines.

---

## Build Process

### Building the Project

1. **Generate Static Files**

   ```bash
   npm --prefix prerender run build
   ```

   - Generates all pages into the `pages/` directory with injected components and structured layouts.

### Serving the Build

1. **Serve the Built Files**

   ```bash
   npm --prefix prerender run serve-dist
   ```

   - Hosts the static files in the `pages/` directory at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

### Cleaning Builds

1. **Rebuild the Project**

   ```bash
   npm --prefix prerender run rebuild
   ```

   - Removes the `pages/` directory and prepares for a fresh build.

---

## Testing

- **Accessibility Tools:** Use [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) or [AXE](https://www.deque.com/axe/) for compliance checks.
- **Responsive Testing:** Utilize browser dev tools to test on various devices.
- **Functionality Checks:** Verify interactive elements like theme toggles and font adjustments.

---

## Deployment

1. **Choose a Deployment Platform**

   - **GitHub Pages**
   - **Netlify**
   - **Vercel**

2. **Deploy the Static Build**

   Upload the contents of the `pages/` directory to your chosen platform, ensuring that `index.html` is served correctly.

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Build Issues:** Verify that all component paths are correct and accessible in `generateWIP.js`.
- **JavaScript Errors:** Check browser console for errors in interactive features.
- **Server Issues:** Ensure no port conflicts when running the development or static servers.
