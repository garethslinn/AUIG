<h2>Why We Use the Term "User Interface" Instead of "Web" or "Website"</h2>
<p>
    The term <strong>"user interface"</strong> (UI) is deliberately chosen to encompass the wide variety of platforms
    and applications where interfaces are designed and developed, including web, mobile, desktop, and even non-screen-based systems.
    While many accessibility guidelines and design practices stem from traditional web design, this guide aims to provide principles
    that apply broadly to all forms of interfaces. Here's why this distinction is important:
</p>

<h3>1. Inclusivity Across Platforms</h3>
<p>
    Not all user interfaces are web-based or browser-dependent. Mobile applications, desktop software, and even interfaces for devices
    like smart TVs, gaming consoles, and IoT devices share similar UI components, such as buttons, forms, and menus. By using
    "user interface," we encourage readers to consider accessibility principles that transcend the web, applying them to their specific platform or language.
</p>

<h3>2. Platform-Specific Variations</h3>
<p>
    While guidelines often reference familiar web elements—such as a "button" or "input field"—it’s important to recognise that
    equivalent elements exist in other environments:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Web:</strong> <code class="language-html">&lt;button&gt;</code> and <code class="language-html">&lt;input&gt;</code> elements.</li>
    <li><strong>Mobile (iOS/Android):</strong> UIButton (iOS), Button (Android).</li>
    <li><strong>Desktop:</strong> Native GUI components like <code class="language-html">NSButton</code> (macOS) or <code class="language-html">JButton</code> (Java Swing).</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Readers should adapt the guidance to their platform, considering the functional equivalent of each UI element.
</p>

<h3>3. Avoiding Platform-Specific Bloat</h3>
<p>
    Attempting to cover every platform or technology in detail would risk overwhelming the guide with unnecessary complexity and
    creating confusion. Instead, focusing on universal principles ensures clarity and usability for all readers. For example:
</p>
<blockquote>
    <strong>Guideline Example:</strong> "Ensure buttons are clearly labeled and provide accessible feedback when interacted with."
</blockquote>
<p>
    <strong>Reader's Responsibility:</strong> Interpret "button" as relevant to their platform, whether it's a physical button on
    a device, a virtual button in a mobile app, or a clickable element on a webpage.
</p>

<h3>4. Universal Design Goals</h3>
<p>
    By framing the discussion around "user interfaces," this guide emphasises accessibility as a core principle of all interface
    design, not just web design. The goal is to empower designers and developers to think beyond their immediate platform, fostering
    solutions that are inclusive and effective across diverse use cases.
</p>

<h3>How to Apply This Guide to Your Platform</h3>
<p>
    Readers should take the accessibility principles outlined here and adapt them to their specific environments. For example:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Web Development:</strong> Follow the recommendations using HTML and CSS standards.</li>
    <li><strong>Mobile Apps:</strong> Translate these guidelines to Swift or Kotlin, ensuring platform-specific accessibility APIs
        (e.g., VoiceOver or TalkBack) are implemented.</li>
    <li><strong>Desktop Applications:</strong> Consider how native components and operating system guidelines align with the principles provided.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    By focusing on universal accessibility principles, this guide avoids unnecessary platform-specific detail while remaining flexible
    enough to support diverse applications. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of the designer or developer to contextualise these
    principles to their platform, ensuring the highest level of accessibility for all users.

<section id="avoid-elements-techniques">
    <h2>Some Elements and Techniques to Avoid - this is not a checklist</h2>
    <ul class="numbers">
        <li><strong>Flashing or Strobing Elements</strong>: Avoid animations or effects with flashing or strobing lights, as they can trigger seizures in users with photosensitivity or epilepsy.</li>
        <li><strong>Overuse of Decorative Fonts</strong>: Avoid using overly decorative, cursive, or condensed fonts, as they can hinder readability, especially for users with dyslexia or cognitive impairments.</li>
        <li><strong>Color-Only Indicators</strong>: Do not rely solely on color to convey meaning (e.g., red for errors or green for success), as this excludes users with color blindness or low vision.</li>
        <li><strong>Auto-Playing Media</strong>: Avoid automatically playing audio or video content, as it can overwhelm users or disrupt assistive technology like screen readers.</li>
        <li><strong>Justified Text</strong>: Avoid fully justified text, which creates uneven spacing between words and can be difficult to read for users with dyslexia or visual impairments.</li>
        <li><strong>Long Dropdown Menus</strong>: Avoid long, complex dropdowns; instead, use typeahead inputs or categorised menus to simplify navigation.</li>
        <li><strong>All-Caps Text</strong>: Avoid using all capital letters for large blocks of text, as it is harder to read and can increase cognitive load.</li>
        <li><strong>Time-Limited Interactions</strong>: Avoid strict time limits for tasks like form completion or interaction, as this can cause anxiety and exclude users who need more time.</li>
        <li><strong>Hidden Content Without Explanation</strong>: Do not hide content or interactive elements unless clearly labeled or accessible via alternative methods (e.g., a screen reader or "show more" buttons).</li>
        <li><strong>Complex Navigational Structures</strong>: Avoid overly complex or nested navigation menus that make it hard for users to locate content, especially for those with cognitive impairments.</li>
        <li><strong>Hover-Only Interactions</strong>: Avoid hover-only states for critical interactions, as they exclude keyboard and touch-screen users.</li>
        <li><strong>Small Click Targets</strong>: Avoid small buttons, links, or icons that are difficult to tap or click, especially for users with motor impairments.</li>
        <li><strong>Excessive Animations</strong>: Avoid excessive or unnecessary animations that can distract users or trigger sensory discomfort for those with neurological conditions like autism or ADHD.</li>
        <li><strong>Unclear Error Messages</strong>: Avoid vague or generic error messages like "Error occurred" without explaining the issue or how to fix it.</li>
        <li><strong>Inaccessible Modals and Popups</strong>: Avoid modals that do not trap focus or provide a clear way to close them, as they can confuse or block users relying on assistive technology.</li>
        <li><strong>Fixed Font Sizes</strong>: Avoid using fixed pixel-based font sizes that prevent users from resising text to suit their needs.</li>
        <li><strong>Low Contrast</strong>: Avoid low contrast between text and background colors, which can make content difficult to read for users with low vision.</li>
        <li><strong>Placeholder-Only Labels</strong>: Avoid relying on placeholders as the sole form field label, as they disappear when users start typing and can confuse users with memory difficulties.</li>
        <li><strong>Overloaded Interfaces</strong>: Avoid cluttered interfaces with too many options, which can overwhelm users with cognitive or attention-related conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Unnecessary CAPTCHA Challenges</strong>: Avoid overly complex CAPTCHA challenges that exclude users with cognitive or motor impairments; use accessible alternatives like reCAPTCHA v3.</li>
