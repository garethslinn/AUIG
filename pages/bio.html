<!-- Section: Accessibility Journey -->
<section id="accessibility-journey">
  <h3>Accessibility Since 2002</h3>
  <p>
    My journey into accessibility began in 2002 with the creation of my first tool, <strong>Hermish</strong>. Although now
    obsolete, Hermish marked the beginning of my dedication to improving web accessibility.
    My passion for this field was further ignited through my personal experience with text-to-speech tools in the early 2000s.
    As someone with ADHD and dyslexia, assistive technology provided tremendous support,
    enabling me to navigate and engage with digital spaces more effectively. This transformative experience made me realise
    that as the web continues to expand, so does its audience and with it, the critical need
    for accessible technologies. This understanding has been the driving force behind my work for over two decades, shaping my
    commitment to inclusivity and innovation in the digital world.

    <h4>Accessibility by Example (2007)</h4>

      In 2007, I wrote <em>Accessibility by Example</em>, a pocket guide aimed at helping developers navigate the complexities of web accessibility. The book provided practical, actionable insights
      during a time when W3C standards were difficult to fully grasp. Although out of print, its impact remains significant.

      focuses on the unique needs of individuals with neurological differences, such as autism, ADHD, and dyslexia.
      These differences shape how users perceive and interact with digital content, yet theyâ€™re often overlooked in design practices.
